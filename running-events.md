## Meetups
Meeting regularly in-person with other Aletheians helps strengthen community bonds. Contributors can run formal and informal meetups to bring people together, help one another and progress the project foward. Below are some things to remember for physical meetups:

* Aletheia has a code of conduct, it needs to be adhered to online and in person.
* Itâ€™s important to book a space in advance, universities should have study and event spaces and for non student contributors you can contact organisations like your local library or cooperative working space.
* Write an agenda to keep the meeting on track. 
* If you are in a position to meet up with people face to face try and have regular meetups. Once every two weeks or once a month is a good cadence. 
* If you want, try and do different things. Whether they're hackathons, workshops, building sessions or just get togethers, you can plan different events to keep your membership engaged. 
* Meetings are great for generating content. Post about your experiences, events, new members, volunteers, wins and lessons learned. 

If you want to plan and run face to face events, Mozilla has a great resource for running awesome events [here](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/running-awesome-community-events/designing-an-open-event/) and [here](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/sprints_events/)

## General event checklist

### Before the event

- Print out a few copies of a one pager with relevent details so people can connect and interact with Aletheia:
  - https://github.com/aletheia-foundation
  - https://twitter.com/aletheia_f
  - https://www.facebook.com/aletheiaf/
  - any relevent hashtags like #mozsprint
- Get stickers and pens for nametags if desired
- Create a welcome pack if desired. Welcome packs can contain relevent event information, and further reading not Aletheia related but related to concepts Aletheia has as core principles, like decentralisation and the Open Web.
- Get different coloured lanyards if you feel you can't remember inidivuals privacy choices or if you are running a larger event
- Create a post event survey

### During the event

- Post your one pager with relevent details prominently
* Ask the venue space organiser for the wifi credentials and post them prominently
* Greet all participants:
  - Ask them their name, and apologise for most likely forgetting it if you're not great with names
  - Ask them to sign in, this can be on a piece of paper (in which case you will need pens) or just on a text document on a laptop.
  - Give them their welcome pack if one was made
  - Ask them if they are fine with having their photo taken
* Get everyone to write their name on a nametag if desired
* If the contributer doesn't have a GitHub account, ask them to create one if they want and help them with this process if need be.
* Passwords are annoying. If the user is creating a new GitHub account and they don't have a password manager, or they do have an account but just don't have a password manager, suggest that they download one and help them with setting it up if need be. Because it is opensource and easy to use, [Keepass](http://keepass.info/) is a good choice.
* Invite the users to the [Aletheia Slack](https://aletheiafoundation.slack.com/) if they desire.

### After the event

* Send out the post event survey
