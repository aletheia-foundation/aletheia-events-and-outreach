## Meetups
Meeting regularly in-person with other Aletheians helps strengthen community bonds. Contributors can run formal and informal meetups to bring people together, help one another and progress the project foward. Below are some things to remember for physical meetups:

* Aletheia has a code of conduct, it needs to be adhered to online and in person.
* Itâ€™s important to book a space in advance, universities should have study and event spaces and for non student contributors you can contact organisations like your local library or cooperative working space.
* Write an agenda to keep the meeting on track. 
* If you are in a position to meet up with people face to face try and have regular meetups. Once every two weeks or once a month is a good cadence. 
* If you want, try and do different things. Whether they're hackathons, workshops, building sessions or just get togethers, you can plan different events to keep your membership engaged. 
* Meetings are great for generating content. Post about your experiences, events, new members, volunteers, wins and lessons learned. 

If you want to plan and run face to face events, Mozilla has a great resource for running awesome events [here](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/running-awesome-community-events/designing-an-open-event/) and [here](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/sprints_events/)
